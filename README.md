Wordpress User Meta Display
==========

This is a simple Wordpress plugin that will allow you to display all meta associated with a user by selecting from a dropdown list.

This plugin will create a submenu "User Meta Display" item under the "Users" menu item in your wordpress installation.

User meta is generated via AJAX (doesn't require page reload) and is protected using Wordpress nonce to prevent unauthorized output of user meta.

This plugin is still under development but hopefully soon will support (and include) a lot more features and customization.
