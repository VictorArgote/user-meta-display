Wordpress User Meta Display
==========

This is a simple Wordpress plugin that will allow you to display all meta associated with a user by selecting from a dropdown list.  You can select how the display list will show the users, by Display Name, User Login, or ID.  Default is Display Name.

This plugin will create a submenu "User Meta Display" item under the "Users" menu item in your wordpress installation.

User meta is generated via AJAX (doesn't require page reload) and is protected using Wordpress nonce to prevent unauthorized output of user meta.
